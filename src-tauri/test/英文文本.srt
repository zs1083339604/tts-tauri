You want to iterate through a PHP array

00:00:03,387 --> 00:00:07,412
identify and remove elements where the value is an empty string

00:00:07,712 --> 00:00:11,375
including strings composed of multiple spaces or newlines

5
00:00:11,750 --> 00:00:12,812
and thenre-index

6
00:00:12,825 --> 00:00:13,425
the array
